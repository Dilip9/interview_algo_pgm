     * LinkedList
     *      A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.
     *      Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient insertions and deletions.
     * Types of Linked Lists
     *      Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
     *      Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
     *      Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.
     * Basic Operations
     *      Insertion: Adding a new node to the list.
     *      Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
     *      Traversal: Accessing each node in the list.
     *      Search: Finding a node with a specific value.
