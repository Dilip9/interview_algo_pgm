    /** Stack: A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
     *  This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
     *  Think of it like a stack of plates: you add new plates to the top and remove plates from the top.
     *  Key Operations:
     *      push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
     *      pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
     *      peek or top: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
     * Queue:
     *  A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
     *  Think of it like a line of people waiting for a service: the first person in line is the first to be served.
     *  Key Operations:
     *      enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
     *      dequeue: Remove the element from the front of the queue.
     *      front or peek: Retrieve the front element without removing it.
